# Diabetes Prediction Model


It is a Data science project in which we need to predict whether a given data point is diabetic or not. Since it comes under Classification technique which is a type of Supervised Machine Learning, here the model is built using different classification algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes , and Support Vector Machine.
